        Zend Framework requires PHP 5.1.4 or higher, although Zend strongly recommended 5.2.3 or higher as there were some
        critical security and performance enhancements introduces between these two versions. You can find more details in the
        <link linkend="requirements">requirements appendix</link>.

        Installing Zend Framework is extremely simple. Once you have downloaded and extracted the framework, you should add the
        /library folder in the distribution to the beginning of your include path. You may also want to move the library folder
        to another- possibly shared- location on your filesystem.

                    This version, available in both <code>.zip</code> and <code>.tar.gz</code> formats, is a good
                    choice for those who are new to Zend Framework.

                    English only or in all available languages. If you anticipate working with the latest Zend
                    Framework developments, consider using a Subversion (SVN) client.

                    Using a <ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</ulink> (SVN) client. Zend Framework
                    is open source software, and the Subversion repository used for its development is publicly
                    available. Consider using SVN to get the Zend Framework if you already use SVN for your
                    application development, want to contribute back to the framework, or need to upgrade your
                    framework version more often than releases occur.

        Once you have a copy of the Zend Framework available, your application needs to be able to access the
        framework classes. Though there are
        <ulink url="http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php">
        several ways to achieve this</ulink>, your PHP
        <ulink url="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.include-path"><code>include_path</code></ulink>
        needs to contain the path to the Zend Framework library.

        Zend provides a <ulink url="http://framework.zend.com/docs/quickstart">QuickStart</ulink> to get you up and running
        as quickly as possible. This is an excellent way to begin learning about the framework with an emphasis
        on real world examples that you can built upon.

        Since Zend Framework components are loosely coupled, you may use a somewhat unique combination of them in your
        own applications. The following chapters provide a comprehensive reference to Zend Framework on a component-by-
        component basis.
