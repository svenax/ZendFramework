  <title>Zend_Wildfire</title>

  <para>
    <classname>Zend_Wildfire</classname> is a component that facilitates communication
    between <acronym>PHP</acronym> code and
    <ulink url="http://www.wildfirehq.org/">Wildfire</ulink> client components.
  </para>
  <para>
    The purpose of the Wildfire Project is to develop standardized communication
    channels between a large variety of components and a dynamic and scriptable
    plugin architecture. At this time the primary
    focus is to provide a system to allow server-side <acronym>PHP</acronym> code to inject logging
    messages into the <ulink url="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</ulink>
    <ulink url="http://getfirebug.com/logging.html">Console</ulink>.
  </para>
  <para>
    For the purpose of logging to Firebug the
    <link linkend="zend.log.writers.firebug"><classname>Zend_Log_Writer_Firebug</classname></link>
    component is provided and a communication protocol has been developed
    that uses <acronym>HTTP</acronym> request and response headers to send data between the server
    and client components. It is great for logging intelligence data, generated during script
    execution, to the browser without interfering with the page content. Debugging
    <acronym>AJAX</acronym> requests that require clean <acronym>JSON</acronym> and
    <acronym>XML</acronym> responses is possible with this approach.
  </para>
  <para>
    There is also a <link linkend="zend.db.profiler.profilers.firebug">
        <classname>Zend_Db_Profiler_Firebug</classname></link> component to log database profiling
    information to Firebug.
  </para>
