    <title>Zend_View_Abstract</title>

    <para>
        <code>Zend_View_Abstract</code> is the base class on which
        <code>Zend_View</code> is built; <code>Zend_View</code> itself simply
        extends it and declares a concrete implementation of the
        <code>_run()</code> method (which is invoked by <code>render()</code>).
    </para>

    <para>
        Many developers find that they want to extend
        <code>Zend_View_Abstract</code> to add custom functionality, and
        inevitably run into issues with its design, which includes a number of
        private members. This document aims to explain the decision behind the
        design.
    </para>

    <para>
        <code>Zend_View</code> is something of an anti-templating engine in that
        it uses PHP natively for its templating. As a result, all of PHP is
        available, and view scripts inherit the scope of their calling object.
    </para>

    <para>
        It is this latter point that is salient to the design decisions.
        Internally, <code>Zend_View::_run()</code> does the following:
    </para>

    <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[
protected function _run()
{
    include func_get_arg(0);
}

]]>
    </programlisting>

    <para>
        As such, the view scripts have access to the current object
        (<code>$this</code>), <emphasis>and any methods or members of that
            object</emphasis>. Since many operations depend on members with
        limited visibility, this poses a problem: the view scripts could
        potentially make calls to such methods or modify critical properties
        directly. Imagine a script overwriting <code>$_path</code> or
        <code>$_file</code> inadvertently -- any further calls to
        <code>render()</code> or view helpers would break!
    </para>

    <para>
        Fortunately, PHP 5 has an answer to this with its visibility
        declarations: private members are not accessible by objects extending a
        given class. This led to the current design: since
        <code>Zend_View</code> <emphasis>extends</emphasis>
        <code>Zend_View_Abstract</code>, view scripts are thus limited to only
        protected or public methods and members of
        <code>Zend_View_Abstract</code> -- effectively limiting the actions it
        can perform, and allowing us to secure critical areas from abuse by view
        scripts.
