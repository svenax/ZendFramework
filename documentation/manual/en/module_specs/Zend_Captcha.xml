        stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans
        Apart"; it is used as a challenge-response to ensure that the individual
        submitting information is a human and not an automated process. Typically, a
        captcha is used with form submissions where authenticated users are not
        necessary, but you desire to prevent spam submissions.

        Captchas can take a variety of forms, including asking logic questions,
        presenting skewed fonts, and presenting images and asking how they
        relate.  Zend_Captcha aims to provide a variety of back ends that may be
        utilized either standalone or in conjunction with
        <code>Zend_Form</code>.
