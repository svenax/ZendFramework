    <title>Zend_Application_Resource_Locale</title>

    <para>
        <classname>Zend_Application_Resource_Locale</classname> can be used to
        set an (application-wide) locale to use in classes that use localization.
    </para>

    <para>
        There are basically three uses of the Locale Resource Plugin.
        With one you don't specify any options for the Resource Plugin.
        By doing so, <classname>Zend_Locale</classname> tries to determine
        what locale to use, and that's it. Doing so is not adivsed. There are
        cases in which <classname>Zend_Locale</classname> cannot detect the
        locale of the user, resulting in an exception. For more info on how
        locales are detected, please see the chapter on <link
        linkend="zend.locale.selection.automatic">automatic locale detection</link>.
    </para>
    
    <example id="zend.application.available-resources.locale.configExampleDetectAndFallback">
        <title>Autodetect locale as well as setting a fallback</title>

        <para>
            Another possibility is to automatically detect the locale to use,
            but, when none can be found, still fall back to the pre-configured
            locale. This is advised for any application that needs to be localized. 
        </para>

        <programlisting language="ini"><![CDATA[
; Try to determine automatically first,
; if unsuccessful, use nl_NL as fallback.
resources.locale.default = "nl_NL"
resources.locale.force = false
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Please note that the last line could be left out, since the
            force-directive defaults to false.
        </para>
    </example>
    
    <example id="zend.application.available-resources.locale.configExampleFallbackOnly">
        <title>Setting a locale only</title>

        <para>
            The last option is to only set a preconfigured locale which is used
            in all cases. This comes in handy when you want the same locale
            throughout your entire application.
        </para>

        <programlisting language="ini"><![CDATA[
; No matter what, the nl_NL locale will be used.
resources.locale.default = "nl_NL"
resources.locale.force = true
]]></programlisting>
    </example>
