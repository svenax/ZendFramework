<sect1 id="zend.mail.encoding">
    <title>Encoding</title>
    <para>
        Text and HTML message bodies and headers are encoded with the quotedprintable mechanism by default.
        All other attachments are encoded via base64 if no other encoding is given in the <code>addAttachment()</code>
        call or assigned to the MIME part object later. 7Bit and 8Bit encoding currently only pass on the
        binary content data.
    </para>
    <para>
        <code>Zend_Mail_Transport_Smtp</code> encodes lines starting with one dot or two dots so that the mail
        does not violate the SMTP protocol.
    </para>
