        <code>Zend_ProgressBar_Adapter_JsPull</code> is the opposite of jsPush,
        as it requires to pull for new updates, instead of pushing updates out
        to the browsers. Generally you should use the adapter with the
        persistence option of the <code>Zend_ProgressBar</code>. On notify,
        the adapter sends a JSON string to the browser, which looks exacly
        like the JSON string which is send by the jsPush adapter. The only
        difference is, that it contains an additional paramter,
        <code>finished</code>, which is either <code>false</code> when
        <code>update()</code> is called or <code>true</code>, when
        <code>finish()</code> is called.

        You can set the adapter options either via the <code>set*</code> methods
        or give an array or a Zend_Config instance with options as first
        parameter to the constructor. The available options are:
