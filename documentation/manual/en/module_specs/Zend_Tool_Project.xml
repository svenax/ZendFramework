        <para>
            Zend_Tool_Project builds on and extends the capabilities of Zend_Tool_Framework to that
            of managing a "project".  In general, a "project" is a planned endeavor or an initiative.
            In the computer world, projects generally are a collection of resources. These resources
            can be files, directories, databases, schemas, images, styles, and more.
        </para>

        <para>
            This same concept applies to Zend Framework projects. In ZF projects, you have controllers,
            actions, views, models, databases and so on and so forth. In terms of Zend_Tool, we need a
            way to track these types of resources - thus Zend_Tool_Project.
        </para>

        <para>
            Zend_Tool_Project is capable of tracking project resources throughout the development
            of a project. So, for example, if in one command you created a controller, and in the next
            command you wish to create an action within that controller, Zend_Tool_Project is gonna have
            to <emphasis>know</emphasis> about the controller file you created so that you can (in the next action),
            be able to append that action to it. This is what keeps our projects up to date and
            <emphasis>stateful</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Another important point to understand about projects is that typically, resources are organized
            in a hierarchical fashion. With that in mind, Zend_Tool_Project is capable of serializing the
            current project into a internal representation that allows it to keep track of not only
            <emphasis>what</emphasis> resources are part of a project at any given time, but also
            <emphasis>where</emphasis> they are in relation to one another.

            Note: the following examples will assume you have the command line interface of
            Zend_Tool_Framework available to you.
        </para>

        <para>
            Note: to issue any of the commands for Zend_Tool_Project with CLI, you must be in the directory
            where the project was initially created.
        </para>

        <para>
            To get started with Zend_Tool_Project, you simply need to create a project.  Creating a project
            is simple: go to a place on your filesystem, create a directory, change to that directory, then
            issue the following command:
        </para>

        <para>
            <code>/tmp/project$ zf create project</code>
        </para>

        <para>
            Optionally, you can create a directory anywhere by the following:
        </para>

        <para>
            <code>$ zf create project /path/to/non-existent-dir</code>
        </para>

        <para>
            The following table will describe the capabilities of providers that are available to
            you.  As you can see in this table, there is a "Project" provider.  The Project provider
            has a couple of actions associated to it, and with those actions a number of options that
            can be used to modify the behavior of the action and provider.
