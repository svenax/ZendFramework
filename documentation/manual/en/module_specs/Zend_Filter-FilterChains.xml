    <title>Filter Chains</title>

    <para>
        Often multiple filters should be applied to some value in a particular order. For example, a
        login form accepts a username that should be only lowercase, alphabetic characters.
        <code>Zend_Filter</code> provides a simple method by which filters may be chained together. The
        following code illustrates how to chain together two filters for the submitted username:

        <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<// Create a filter chain and add filters to the chain
$filterChain = new Zend_Filter();
$filterChain->addFilter(new Zend_Filter_Alpha())
            ->addFilter(new Zend_Filter_StringToLower());

// Filter the username
$username = $filterChain->filter($_POST['username']);]]>
        </programlisting>

        Filters are run in the order they were added to <code>Zend_Filter</code>. In the above example, the
        username is first removed of any non-alphabetic characters, and then any uppercase characters are
        converted to lowercase.

    </para>

    <para>
        Any object that implements <code>Zend_Filter_Interface</code> may be used in a filter chain.
    </para>
