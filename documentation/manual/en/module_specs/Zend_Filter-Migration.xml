    <title>Migrating from Previous Versions</title>

    <para>
        This chapter documents primarily backwards compatibility breaks made in
        <classname>Zend_Filter</classname>, and should serve to aid in migration from previous
        versions.

    <sect2 id="zend.filter.migration.zf2105">
        <title>Migrating from versions prior to 1.9</title>

        <para>
            Prior to the 1.9 release, <classname>Zend_Filter</classname> allowed
            the usage of the static <methodname>get()</methodname> method. As with
            release 1.9 this method has been renamed to
            <methodname>filterStatic()</methodname> to be more descriptive. The
            old <methodname>get()</methodname> method is marked as depreciated.
