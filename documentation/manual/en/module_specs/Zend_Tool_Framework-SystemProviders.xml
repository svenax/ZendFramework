    <title>Shipped System Providers</title>
    <para>
        In addition to the more useful project based providers that come shipped with Zend_Tool_Project,
        there are also some more basic, but interesting providers that come built into 
        Zend_Tool_Framework.  Some of these exist for the purpose of providing a means via the command line
        to extract information, such as the version... while others are intended to aid the developer
        when creating additional providers.

    <sect2 id="zend.tool.framework.system-providers.version">
        <title>The Version Provider</title>
        
        <para>
            The version provider is included so that you may determine which version of the framework
            that the <code>zf</code> or Zend_Tool is currently set to work with.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Through the command line, simply run <code>zf show version</code>.

    <sect2 id="zend.tool.framework.system-providers.manifest">
        <title>The Manifest Provider</title>
        
        <para>
            The manifest provider is included so that you may determine what kind of "manifest"
            information is available during the Zend_Tool runtime.  Manifest data is information that
            is attached to specific objects during Zend_Tools runtime.  The most important (for the 
            purposes of the zf command line tool) peice of information is setup by the CLI/Console client.
            Inside the manifest you will find the console specific namings that you are expected to
            use when calling certain commands.  Data found in the manfest can be used by any provider
            or client on an as needed basis.
