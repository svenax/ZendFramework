    <title>JSON Helper</title>

    <para>
        When creating views that return JSON, it's important to also set the
        appropriate response header. The JSON view helper does exactly that. In
        addition, by default, it disables layouts (if currently enabled), as
        layouts generally aren't used with JSON responses.
    </para>

    <para>
        The JSON helper sets the following header:
    </para>

    <programlisting role="text"><![CDATA[
Content-Type: application/json
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        Most AJAX libraries look for this header when parsing responses to
        determine how to handle the content.
    </para>

    <para>
        Usage of the JSON helper is very straightforward:
    </para>

    <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
<?= $this->json($this->data) ?>
?>]]></programlisting>
