        Zend_Acl provides lightweight and flexible access control list (ACL) functionality
        and privileges management. In general, an application may utilize such functionality
        to control access to certain protected objects by other requesting objects.

    <para>
        Through the specification and use of an access control list (ACL), an application may control
        how requesting objects (Roles) are granted access to protected objects (Resources).

    <sect2 id="zend.acl.introduction.resources">
        <title>About Resources</title>
        <para>
            In Zend_Acl, creating a Resource is very simple. Zend_Acl provides
            <code>Zend_Acl_Resource_Interface</code> to facilitate developers' creating Resources. A class need only
            implement this interface, which consists of a single method, <code>getResourceId()</code>, in order
            for Zend_Acl to consider the object to be a Resource. Additionally, <code>Zend_Acl_Resource</code> is
            included with Zend_Acl as a basic Resource implementation for developers to extend where desirable.
        </para>
        <para>
            Zend_Acl provides a tree structure to which multiple Resources (or "areas under access control")
            can be added. Since Resources are stored in such a tree structure, they can be organized from the
            general (toward the tree root) to the specific (toward the tree leaves). Queries upon
            a specific Resource will automatically search the Resource's hierarchy for rules assigned to ancestor
            Resources, allowing for simple inheritance of rules. For example, if a default rule is to be
            applied to each building in a city, one would simply assign the rule to the city, instead of
            assigning the same rule to each building. Some buildings may require exceptions to such a
            rule, however, and this is achieved easily in Zend_Acl by assigning such exception rules to
            each such building that requires an exception to the rule. A Resource may inherit from only one
            parent Resource, though this parent Resource can have its own parent Resource, and so on.
        </para>
        <para>
            Zend_Acl also supports privileges upon Resources (e.g., "create", "read", "update", "delete"), and
            the developer can assign rules that affect all privileges or specific privileges upon a Resource.
        </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="zend.acl.introduction.roles">
        <title>About Roles</title>
        <para>
            Like with Resources, creating a Role is also very simple. Zend_Acl provides
            <code>Zend_Acl_Role_Interface</code> to facilitate developers' creating Roles. A class need only
            implement this interface, which consists of a single method, <code>getRoleId()</code>, in order
            for Zend_Acl to consider the object to be a Role. Additionally, <code>Zend_Acl_Role</code> is
            included with Zend_Acl as a basic Role implementation for developers to extend where desirable.
        </para>
        <para>
            In Zend_Acl, a Role may inherit from one or more Roles. This is to support inheritance of rules
            among Roles. For example, a user Role, such as "sally", may belong to one or more parent Roles,
            such as "editor" and "administrator". The developer can assign rules to "editor" and
            "administrator" separately, and "sally" would inherit such rules from both, without having to
            assign rules directly to "sally".
        </para>
        <para>
            Though the ability to inherit from multiple Roles is very useful, multiple inheritance also
            introduces some degree of complexity. The following example illustrates the ambiguity condition and how
            Zend_Acl solves it.
        </para>
        <example id="zend.acl.introduction.roles.example.multiple_inheritance">
            <title>Multiple inheritance between Roles</title>
            <para>
                The following code defines three base Roles - "<code>guest</code>", "<code>member</code>", and
                "<code>admin</code>" - from which other Roles may inherit. Then, a Role identified by
                "<code>someUser</code>" is established and inherits from the three other Roles. The order in
                which these Roles appear in the <code>$parents</code> array is important. When necessary,
                Zend_Acl searches for access rules defined not only for the queried Role (herein,
                "<code>someUser</code>"), but also upon the Roles from which the queried Role inherits
                (herein, "<code>guest</code>", "<code>member</code>", and "<code>admin</code>"):
            </para>

require_once 'Zend/Acl.php';
$acl = new Zend_Acl();

$acl->addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('guest'))
    ->addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('member'))
    ->addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('admin'));

$parents = array('guest', 'member', 'admin');
$acl->addRole(new Zend_Acl_Role('someUser'), $parents);

            </programlisting>
            <para>
                Since there is no rule specifically defined for the "<code>someUser</code>" Role and
                "<code>someResource</code>", Zend_Acl must search for rules that may be defined for Roles that
                "<code>someUser</code>" inherits. First, the "<code>admin</code>" role is visited, and there
                is no access rule defined for it. Next, the "<code>member</code>" role is visited, and
                Zend_Acl finds that there is a rule specifying that "<code>member</code>" is allowed access to
                "<code>someResource</code>".
            </para>
            <para>
                If Zend_Acl were to continue examining the rules defined for other parent Roles, however, it
                would find that "<code>guest</code>" is denied access to "<code>someResource</code>". This
                fact introduces an ambiguity because now "<code>someUser</code>" is both denied and allowed
                access to "<code>someResource</code>", by reason of having inherited conflicting rules from
                different parent Roles.
            </para>
            <para>
                Zend_Acl resolves this ambiguity by completing a query when it finds the first rule that is
                directly applicable to the query. In this case, since the "<code>member</code>" Role is
                examined before the "<code>guest</code>" Role, the example code would print
                "<code>allowed</code>".
            </para>
        </example>

            <para>
                When specifying multiple parents for a Role, keep in mind that the last parent listed is the

            An ACL can represent any set of physical or virtual objects that you wish.
            For the purposes of demonstration, however, we will create a basic Content Management System ACL
            that maintains several tiers of groups over a wide variety of areas. To create a new ACL object,
            we instantiate the ACL with no parameters:

        <title>Registering Roles</title>

        <para>
            Content Management Systems will nearly always require a hierarchy of permissions
            to determine the authoring capabilities of its users. There may be a 'Guest' group to
            allow limited access for demonstrations, a 'Staff' group for the majority of CMS users
            who perform most of the day-to-day operations, an 'Editor' group for those responsible for publishing,
            reviewing, archiving and deleting content, and finally an 'Administrator' group whose tasks may
            include all of those of the other groups as well as maintenance of sensitive information,
            user management, back-end configuration data and backup/export. This set of permissions can be
            represented in a Role registry, allowing each group to inherit privileges from 'parent' groups,
            as well as providing distinct privileges for their unique group only.
            The permissions may be expressed as follows:

        <para>
            Now that the ACL contains the relevant Roles, rules can be established that define how
            Resources may be accessed by Roles. You may have noticed that we have not defined any particular
            Resources for this example, which is simplified to illustrate that the rules apply to all Resources.
            Zend_Acl provides an implementation whereby rules need only be assigned from general to specific,
            minimizing the number of rules needed, because Resources and Roles inherit rules that are defined upon
            their ancestors.

        <note>
            <para>
                In general, Zend_Acl obeys a given rule if and only if a more specific rule does not apply.
