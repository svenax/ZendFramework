    <title>Character Sets</title>
    <para>
        <classname>Zend_Mail</classname> does not check for the correct character set of the mail parts. When
        instantiating <classname>Zend_Mail</classname>, a charset for the e-mail itself may be given. It defaults to
        <code>iso-8859-1</code>. The application has to make sure that all parts added to that mail object
        have their content encoded in the correct character set. When creating a new mail part, a different
        charset can be given for each part.

            Character sets are only applicable for message parts in text format.
