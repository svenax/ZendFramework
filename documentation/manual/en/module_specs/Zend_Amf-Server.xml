    <para>
        <classname>Zend_Amf_Server</classname> provides an <acronym>RPC</acronym>-style server for
        handling requests made from the Adobe Flash Player using the <acronym>AMF</acronym>
        protocol. Like all Zend Framework server classes, it follows the SoapServer
        <acronym>API</acronym>, providing an easy to remember interface for creating servers.
    </para>

    <example id="zend.amf.server.basic">
        <title>Basic AMF Server</title>

        <para>
            Let's assume that you have created a class <emphasis>Foo</emphasis> with a
            variety of public methods. You may create an <acronym>AMF</acronym> server using the
            following code:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$server = new Zend_Amf_Server();
$server->setClass('Foo');
$response = $server->handle();
echo $response;
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Alternately, you may choose to attach a simple function as a
            callback instead:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$server = new Zend_Amf_Server();
$server->addFunction('myUberCoolFunction');
$response = $server->handle();
echo $response;
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            You could also mix and match multiple classes and functions. When
            doing so, we suggest namespacing each to ensure that no method name
            collisions occur; this can be done by simply passing a second string
            argument to either <methodname>addFunction()</methodname> or
            <methodname>setClass()</methodname>:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$server = new Zend_Amf_Server();
$server->addFunction('myUberCoolFunction', 'my')
       ->setClass('Foo', 'foo')
       ->setClass('Bar', 'bar');
$response = $server->handle();
echo $response;
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            The <classname>Zend_Amf_Server</classname> also allows services to be dynamically
            loaded based on a supplied directory path. You may add as many directories as you wish
            to the server. The order that you add the directories to the server will be the
            order that the <acronym>LIFO</acronym> search will be performed on the directories to
            match the class. Adding directories is completed with the
            <methodname>addDirectory()</methodname> method.
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
$server->addDirectory(dirname(__FILE__) .'/../services/');
$server->addDirectory(dirname(__FILE__) .'/../package/');
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            When calling remote services your source name can have underscore ("_") and dot (".")
            directory delimiters. When an underscore is used <acronym>PEAR</acronym> and Zend
            Framework class naming conventions will be respected. This means that if you call the
            service <classname>com_Foo_Bar</classname> the server will look for the file
            <filename>Bar.php</filename> in the each of the included paths at
            <filename>com/Foo/Bar.php</filename>. If the dot notation is used for your remote
            service such as <filename>com.Foo.Bar</filename> each included path will have
            <filename>com/Foo/Bar.php</filename> append to the end to autoload
            <filename>Bar.php</filename>
        </para>

        <para>
            All <acronym>AMF</acronym> requests sent to the script will then be handled by the
            server, and an <acronym>AMF</acronym> response will be returned.
        </para>

        <title>All Attached Methods and Functions Need Docblocks</title>

        <para>
            Like all other server components in Zend Framework, you must document your class
            methods using <acronym>PHP</acronym> docblocks. At the minimum, you
            need to provide annotations for each required argument as well as
            the return value. As examples:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
// Function to attach:

        return $greeting . ', ' . $name;

            Other annotations may be used, but will be ignored.

        <title>Connecting to the Server from Flex</title>

        <para>
            Connecting to your <classname>Zend_Amf_Server</classname> from your Flex
            project is quite simple; you simply need to point your endpoint <acronym>URI</acronym>
            to your <classname>Zend_Amf_Server</classname> script.
        </para>

        <para>
            Say, for instance, you have created your server and placed it in the
            <filename>server.php</filename> file in your application root, and thus the
            <acronym>URI</acronym> is <filename>http://example.com/server.php</filename>. In this
            case, you would modify your <filename>services-config.xml</filename> file to set the
            channel endpoint uri attribute to this value.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you have never created a <filename>service-config.xml</filename> file you can do so
            by opening your project in your Navigator window. Right click on the project name and
            select 'properties'. In the Project properties dialog go into 'Flex Build Path' menu,
            'Library path' tab and be sure the '<filename>rpc.swc</filename>' file is added to your
            projects path and Press Ok to close the window.
        </para>
        <para>
            You will also need to tell the compiler to use the
            <filename>service-config.xml</filename> to find the RemoteObject endpoint. To do this
            open your project properties panel again by right clicking on the project folder from
            your Navigator and selecting properties. From the properties popup select 'Flex
            Compiler' and add the string: -services "services-config.xml". Press Apply then OK to
            return to update the option. What you have just done is told the Flex compiler to look
            to the <filename>services-config.xml</filename> file for runtime variables that will be
            used by the RemotingObject class.
        </para>
        <para>
            We now need to tell Flex which services configuration file to use for connecting to
            our remote methods. For this reason create a new 'services-config.xml' file into your
            Flex project src folder. To do this right click on the project folder and select
            'new' 'File' which will popup a new window. Select the project folder and then name
            the file 'services-config.xml' and press finish.
        </para>
        <para>
            Flex has created the new <filename>services-config.xml</filename> and has it open. Use
            the following example text for your <filename>services-config.xml</filename> file. Make
            sure that you update your endpoint to match that of your testing server. Make sure you
            save the file.

        <para>
            There are two key points in the example. First, but last in the

        <para>
            Notice that we've given this channel an identifier, "zend-endpoint".
            The example create a service destination that refers to this channel,
            assigning it an ID as well -- in this case "zend".
        </para>

        <para>
            Within our Flex <acronym>MXML</acronym> files, we need to bind a RemoteObject to the
            service. In <acronym>MXML</acronym>, this might be done as follows:

        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[

        <para>
            Here, we've defined a new remote object identified by "myservice"
            bound to the service destination "zend" we defined in the
            <filename>services-config.xml</filename> file. We then call methods on it
            in our ActionScript by simply calling "myservice.&lt;method&gt;".
            As an example:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="ActionScript"><![CDATA[
myservice.hello("Wade");
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            When namespacing, you would use

            By default, all exceptions thrown in your attached classes or
            functions will be caught and returned as <acronym>AMF</acronym> ErrorMessages. However,
            the content of these ErrorMessage objects will vary based on whether

        </para>

        <para>
            When in production mode, only the exception code will be returned.
            If you disable production mode -- something that should be done for
            testing only -- most exception details will be returned: the
            exception message, line, and backtrace will all be attached.
        </para>

        <para>

            <para>
                We recommend disabling production mode only when in development.
                Exception messages and backtraces can contain sensitive system
                information that you may not wish for outside parties to access.
                Even though <acronym>AMF</acronym> is a binary format, the specification is now
                open, meaning anybody can potentially deserialize the payload.
            </para>
        </note>

        <para>
            One area to be especially careful with is <acronym>PHP</acronym> errors themselves.
            When the <emphasis>display_errors</emphasis> <acronym>INI</acronym> directive is
            enabled, any <acronym>PHP</acronym> errors for the current error reporting level are
            rendered directly in the output -- potentially disrupting the <acronym>AMF</acronym>
            response payload. We suggest turning off the <emphasis>display_errors</emphasis>
            directive in production to prevent such problems

            and then we will walk through the code to describe what each element's role is.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="as"><![CDATA[
package {
  import flash.display.MovieClip;
  import flash.events.*;
  import flash.net.NetConnection;
  import flash.net.Responder;

  public class Main extends MovieClip {
    private var gateway:String = "http://example.com/server.php";

    private function onResult(result:Object):void {
      // Display the returned data
      trace(String(result));
    }
    private function onFault(fault:Object):void {
      trace(String(fault.description));
    }
  }
}
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            We first need to import two ActionScript libraries that perform the bulk of the work.
            The first is NetConnection which acts like a by directional pipe between the client and
            the server. The second is a Responder object which handles the return values from the
            server related to the success or failure of the call.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="as"><![CDATA[
import flash.net.NetConnection;
import flash.net.Responder;
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            In the class we need three variables to represent the NetConnection, Responder, and
            the gateway <acronym>URL</acronym> to our <classname>Zend_Amf_Server</classname>
            installation.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="as"><![CDATA[
private var gateway:String = "http://example.com/server.php";
private var connection:NetConnection;
private var responder:Responder;
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            In the Main constructor we create a responder and a new connection to the
            <classname>Zend_Amf_Server</classname> endpoint. The responder defines two different
            methods for handling the response from the server. For simplicity I have called these
            onResult and onFault.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="as"><![CDATA[
responder = new Responder(onResult, onFault);
connection = new NetConnection;
connection.connect(gateway);
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            In the onComplete function which is run as soon as the construct has completed we send
            the data to the server. We need to add one more line that makes a call to the
            <classname>Zend_Amf_Server</classname> World->hello function.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="as"><![CDATA[
connection.call("World.hello", responder, params);
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            When we created the responder variable we defined an onResult and onFault function to
            handle the response from the server. We added this function for the successful result
            from the server. A successful event handler is run every time the connection is handled
            properly to the server.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="as"><![CDATA[
private function onResult(result:Object):void {
    // Display the returned data
    trace(String(result));
}
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            The onFault function, is called if there was an invalid response from the server. This
            happens when there is an error on the server, the <acronym>URL</acronym> to the server
            is invalid, the remote service or method does not exist, and any other connection
            related issues.
        </para>
        <programlisting language="as"><![CDATA[
private function onFault(fault:Object):void {
    trace(String(fault.description));
}
]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            Adding in the ActionScript to make the remoting connection is now complete. Running the
            ZendExample file now makes a connection to Zend Amf. In review you have added the
            required variables to open a connection to the remote server, defined what methods
            should be used when your application receives a response from the server, and finally
            displayed the returned data to output via <methodname>trace()</methodname>.
