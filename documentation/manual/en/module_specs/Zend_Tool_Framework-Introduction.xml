    <para>
        <code>Zend_Tool_Framework</code> is a framework for exposing common
        functionalities such as the creation of project scaffolds, code
        generation, search index generation, and much more. Functionality may be
        written and exposed via PHP classes dropped into the PHP
        <code>include_path</code>, providing incredible flexibility of
        implementation. The functionality may then be consumed by writing
        implementation and/or protocol-specific clients -- such as console
        clients, XML-RPC, SOAP, and much more.

            <para>
                <code>Common interfaces and abstracts</code> that allow
                developers to create functionality and capabilities that are
                dispatchable by tooling clients.

            <para>
                <emphasis>Base client functionality</emphasis> and a concrete
                console implementation that connect external tools and
                interfaces to the <code>Zend_Tool_Framework</code>. The Console
                client may be used in CLI environments such as unix shells and
                the Windows console.

                <emphasis>"Provider" and "Manifest" interfaces</emphasis> that
                can be utilized by the tooling system. "Providers" represent the
                functional aspect of the framework, and define the actions that
                tooling clients may call. "Manifests" act as metadata registries
                that provide additional context for the various defined
                providers.
