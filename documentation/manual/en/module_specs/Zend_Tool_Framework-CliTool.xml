    <title>Using the CLI Tool</title>

    <para>
        The CLI, or command line tool (internally known as the console tool), is
        currently the primary interface for dispatching <code>Zend_Tool</code>
        requests. With the CLI tool, developers can issue tooling requests
        inside a the "command line windows", also commonly known as a "terminal"
        window. This environment is predominant in the *nix environment, but
        also has a common implementation in windows with the
        <code>cmd.exe</code>, console2 and also with the Cygwin project.
    </para>

        <title>Setting up the CLI tool</title>

        <para>
            To issue tooling requests via the command line client, you first
            need to setup the client so that your system can handle the "zf"
            command. The command line client, for all intents and purposes, is
            the <code>.sh</code> or <code>.bat</code> file that is provided with
            your Zend Framework distribution. In trunk, it can be found here:
            <ulink url="http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/bin/">http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/bin/</ulink>
        </para>

        <para>
            As you can see, there are 3 files in the <code>bin/</code>
            directory: a <code>zf.php</code>, <code>zf.sh</code>, and
            <code>zf.bat</code>. The <code>zf.sh</code> and the
            <code>zf.bat</code> are the operating system specific client
            wrappers: <code>zf.sh</code> for the *nix environment, and zf.bat
            for the Win32 environment. These client wrappers are responsible
            for finding the proper <code>php.exe</code>, finding the
            <code>zf.php</code>, and passing on the client request. The
            <code>zf.php</code> is the responsible for handling understanding
            your environment, constructing the proper include_path, and passing
            what is provided on the command line to the proper library component
            for dispatching.
        </para>

        <para>
            Ultimately, you want to ensure two things to make everything work
            regardless of the operating system you are on:

                    <code>zf.sh/zf.bat</code> is reachable from your system
                    path. This is the ability to call <code>zf</code> from
                    anywhere on your command line, regardless of what your
                    current working directory is.

            <emphasis>Note:</emphasis> while the above are the most ideal
            requirements, you can simply download Zend Framework and expect it
            to work as <code>./path/to/zf.php</code> some command.

        <title>Setting up the CLI tool on Unix-like Systems</title>

        <para>
            The most common setup in the *nix environment, is to copy the
            <code>zf.sh</code> and <code>zf.php</code> into the same directory
            as your PHP binary. This can generally be found in one of the
            following places:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="text"><![CDATA[
/usr/bin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/ZendServer/bin/
/Applications/ZendServer/bin/
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            To find out the location of your PHP binary, you can execute 'which
            php' on the command line. This will return the location of the php
            binary you will be using to run php scripts in this environment.
        </para>

        <para>
            The next order of business is to ensure that the Zend Framework
            library is setup correctly inside of the system PHP
            <code>include_path</code>. To find out where your
            <code>include_path</code> is located, you can execute 'php -i' and
            look for the <code>include_path</code> variable, or more succinctly,
            execute 'php -i | grep include_path'. Once you have found where
            your <code>include_path</code> is located (this will generally be
            something like /usr/lib/php, /usr/share/php, /usr/local/lib/php, or
            similar), ensure that the contents of the library/ directory are put
            inside your <code>include_path</code> specified directory.
        </para>

        <para>
            Once you have done those two things, you should be able to issue a

        <para>
            <emphasis>ALTERNATIVE SETUP</emphasis> involves keeping the Zend
            Framework download together as is, and creating a link from a PATH
            location to the <code>zf.sh</code>. What this means is you can
            place the contents of the ZendFramework download into a location
            such as <code>/usr/local/share/ZendFramework</code>, or more locally
            like <code>/home/username/lib/ZendFramework</code>, and creating a
            symbolic link to the <code>zf.sh</code>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Assuming you want to put the link inside <code>/usr/local/bin</code>
            (this could also work for placing the link inside
            <code>/home/username/bin/</code> for example) you would issue a
            command similar to this: </para>

        <para>
            This will create a link which you should be able to access globally
